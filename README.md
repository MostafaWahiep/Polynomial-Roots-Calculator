# Polynomial Roots Calculator

Solving all the roots of the input polynomial of any degree simultaneously including the complex solutions
using Durand-Kerner method.

## To Run
Your input should follow some rules:

    1- Contains only numbers and 'x', '+', '-', '^' and spaces

    2- After the power is only a number

    3- After x is space or power or an end line

    4- After the sign is space and after the space is x or a number

    5- one space before the sign and other one after the space 
## Examples

    1x^21 - x^16 - 14x^8 - 6x^8 + 24x + 40

    x^70 + 5.65x^38 - 22x^23 + 5x^8 + 30
