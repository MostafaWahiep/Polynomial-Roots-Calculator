# Polynomial Roots Calculator

Solving all the roots of the input polynomial of any degree simultaneously including the complex solutions
using Durand-Kerner method.

## To Run
Your input should follow some rules:

    1- The input consists only of numbers, 'x', '+', '-', '.', '^', and spaces.

    2- Following the exponent must be a number.
 
## Examples

    1x^21 - x^16 - 14x^8 - 6x^8 + 24x + 40

    x^70+5.65x^38-22x^23+5x^8+30
